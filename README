# How to setup?

1. Launch to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home)
2. Create a new app service.
3. Create a new bot channels registration and keep a record of the bot id and bot password. Add the bot id and bot password to IdiotBot.Business.MockSecretVault.Vault in the source code.
4. There are two ways to create a pair of bot id and bot password. The first one is to create them when creating the bot channels registration. The other one is to firstly create a app registration and generate a secret for this registration. And then set them to the bot channels registration when creating the bot channels registration.
4. Go to Setting menu of the create bot channels registration and set message endpoint to the create app service plus /api/messages.
5. Pulish IdiotBot.Api to the app service.
